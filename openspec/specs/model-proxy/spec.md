# model-proxy Specification

## Purpose
定义父进程持有上游凭证的模型代理契约：会话 bearer 鉴权、原始请求与响应流透传、错误映射、资源回收及仅含会话凭证环境变量名的托管模型配置；同时定义用于离线集成验证的 OpenAI 兼容假上游。
## Requirements
### Requirement: 假上游夹具契约
`server/test/support/fake-upstream.mjs` SHALL be a zero-dependency local OpenAI-compatible streaming fixture, importable through `start({port?,apiKey?})` and runnable directly by Node. It SHALL expose the actual bound port and asynchronous close, default to loopback/random port and expected bearer key `fake`, and permit an in-process expected-key override. One handler SHALL serve POST /chat/completions and POST /v1/chat/completions to satisfy the literal fixture path and the parent CI base URL. Missing/wrong Authorization SHALL return401 JSON. For authenticated requests, the last user message containing WORKBUDDY_FAKE_ERROR SHALL return500 OpenAI-shaped JSON before any streaming branch. Otherwise messages without role:tool SHALL receive one streamed bash tool call with arguments {"command":"echo workbuddy-smoke"} and finish_reason:tool_calls; messages with role:tool SHALL receive at least three content deltas concatenating exactly to `你好，这是 WorkBuddy 的第一条流式回复。`, with finish_reason:stop. Successful streams SHALL use OpenAI chat.completion.chunk records and end with data: [DONE]. CLI SHALL honor FAKE_UPSTREAM_PORT, report actual readiness without credentials, and release resources on termination.

#### Scenario: Two-round model script
- WHEN valid bearer requests first omit role:tool and then include the resulting tool message
- THEN the first response reconstructs exactly one bash function call and tool_calls finish, and the second has at least three content events with the exact required text and stop finish; both have canonical chunk metadata and final DONE

#### Scenario: Authentication and expected key override
- WHEN requests omit bearer, use a wrong bearer or use the default key against an instance configured with a different key
- THEN401 JSON is returned without a successful stream; the correct configured bearer permits the expected branch, and no credentials appear in emitted diagnostics

#### Scenario: Last-user error selection
- WHEN the last user message's string or text-part content contains WORKBUDDY_FAKE_ERROR, regardless of a tool message later in the array
- THEN500 OpenAI-shaped error JSON is returned without SSE; a marker only in an older user message does not override a later ordinary user message

#### Scenario: Both declared mount points
- WHEN the fixture is addressed through /chat/completions or the parent's /v1 base plus /chat/completions
- THEN identical authentication/branch/framing behavior is supplied by the same implementation; unrelated routes do not produce a successful completion

#### Scenario: Invalid request and recovery
- WHEN an authenticated request contains malformed JSON or messages is not an array
- THEN400 JSON is returned, and a subsequent valid request still completes normally

#### Scenario: Imported instance ownership
- WHEN the module is imported and two instances are explicitly started with independent expected keys
- THEN import alone does not listen; each start returns its actual usable port, instances do not share credentials, and close releases listener/sockets including after an aborted client and repeated cleanup

#### Scenario: Standalone startup and shutdown
- WHEN Node runs the script with an explicit FAKE_UPSTREAM_PORT or with the variable unset
- THEN it listens on that port or an OS-selected port, emits a parseable actual-port readiness line only after binding, serves the same contract over real HTTP, and exits/reclaims the port on SIGTERM

#### Scenario: Failed CLI binding
- WHEN the configured port is invalid or already occupied
- THEN startup fails nonzero without false readiness, leaked server ownership or credential-bearing diagnostics

### Requirement: 透传端点与 bearer 鉴权
app-server SHALL expose POST /v1/chat/completions through registerModelProxy(app,{upstream,tokens}). model-proxy SHALL own TokenLookup={lookup(token:string):string|null}; it SHALL NOT import sessions or implement TokenRegistry. Canonical typed errors SHALL come from core/errors, with the existing HTTP mapper supplied by the caller.
Authorization SHALL carry a64hex bearer whose exact lookup hits a live runtime. Missing, malformed, unknown or revoked bearer SHALL return401 unauthorized with no upstream request. Authentication SHALL precede upstream configuration checks and body parsing; absent upstream configuration yields502 agent_unavailable only after successful authentication. Every proxy response, including errors, SHALL carry Cache-Control:no-store without changing sibling cache/guard policy.
Authenticated, configured requests SHALL accept JSON media/syntax with a4MiB raw-byte limit and forward the original body bytes and content-type to the configured baseURL plus /chat/completions. InvalidJSON/unsupportedmedia/overlimit SHALL produce400 bad_request before upstream contact. No message-semantic parsing, body reserialization or message logging is permitted. Upstream Authorization SHALL be replaced with `Bearer <configured apiKey>`; client bearer/cookie SHALL NOT be forwarded as headers.
Non5xx upstream status, content-type and opaque body bytes SHALL be streamed in order without waiting for the complete response; the proxy SHALL NOT follow redirects or transform response body bytes. HTTP5xx SHALL discard upstream errorbody and return sanitized local502 agent_unavailable. Connection failure or failure to establish the applicable transport (DNS/TCP/TLS) within10,000ms SHALL return the same502. The timer SHALL end when transport is established; it SHALL NOT impose a response-header/TTFT or whole-response deadline. No retries are added.
Before downstream commitment, upstream transport failure SHALL map to502; after commitment, it SHALL terminate the failed stream without appending a JSON error or falseDONE. Downstream cancellation and app shutdown SHALL release owned upstream requests/responses/timers/connections, including pending header acquisition. Generated errors/diagnostics SHALL NOT expose keys, sessionbearers or raw upstream error details. The module SHALL NOT register product startup assembly, models.yml or cookie-auth exemptions.

#### Scenario: Invalid bearer never reaches upstream
- WHEN Authorization is missing, malformed/non64hex, unknown or revoked, including malformed bodies and absent upstream configuration
- THEN401 unauthorized and no-store are returned before parsing/config failure, with zero upstream requests

#### Scenario: Missing configuration after valid authentication
- WHEN a valid token is supplied but upstream is absent
- THEN502 agent_unavailable and no-store are returned, without throwing during module registration or affecting siblinghealth

#### Scenario: Byte-preserving credential substitution
- WHEN a valid token sends JSON containing distinct whitespace, escape spelling and multibyte text with an explicit JSON content-type
- THEN the recording real upstream receives identical bytes/content-type and the configured APIkey bearer, never the incoming bearer/cookie as forwardedheaders

#### Scenario: Real two-round fake model
- WHEN authenticated requests through the proxy reach the #88 fake-upstream first without tool role and then with tool result
- THEN its bash toolcall round and exact multievent Chinese reply/DONE reach the client unchanged; the proxy does not interpret tool/message semantics

#### Scenario: Incremental non5xx passthrough
- WHEN a real upstream emits the first bytes then holds the response open until the downstream observes them
- THEN the client observes those bytes before upstreamcompletion, subsequent bytes preserve order/exactvalue, and non5xx status/content-type (including non200 such as429) remain unchanged withno-store

#### Scenario: Upstream failures normalized
- WHEN upstream returns HTTP500 or another5xx, refuses connection, or DNS/TCP/TLS connection establishment remains incomplete beyond10,000ms
- THEN local502 agent_unavailable/no-store replaces rawupstreambody/details, without leaked credentials or successfulstreamcompletion

#### Scenario: Parser byte limit and sibling isolation
- WHEN a configured authenticated request is malformedJSON, unsupportedmedia or exceeds4MiB rawbytes
- THEN400 bad_request/no-store occurs before upstreamcontact; a validJSON request of exactly4MiB is forwarded byte-identically
- WHEN siblingauth/API routes parse requests after proxy registration
- THEN their existing parser/bodylimit/guard/cache behavior is unchanged; /v1 does not require a cookie or broadenpublicexemptions

#### Scenario: Cancellation and late stream failure
- WHEN the downstream disconnects, appclose occurs while an upstream is pending, or upstream resets after responsebytes have begun
- THEN owned upstream work settles/reclaims without unhandled errors or hangs; late failure closes the downstream stream rather than producing a forgedJSON envelope orDONE

#### Scenario: Long established stream
- WHEN a response has begun normally and remains open beyond10seconds
- THEN the connection-establishment deadline does not cut it off; normal completion or clientcancellation still performs cleanup

#### Scenario: Established transport with delayed headers
- WHEN the appropriate transport connection is already established but the model has not yet sent response headers after10seconds
- THEN this connection timer SHALL NOT produce502 or cancel the request; later headers/body pass normally, while clientdisconnect/appclose still cancel owned pending work

### Requirement: 托管 models.yml
The model-proxy module SHALL export deriveProxyBaseUrl(address:AddressInfo):string and writeManagedModelsYml(agentDir,{proxyBaseUrl,modelId}):Promise<void>. Actual TCP listen addresses SHALL map wildcard0.0.0.0 to127.0.0.1 and wildcard:: to::1; explicit IPv4/IPv6 SHALL be retained, IPv6 enclosed in brackets, actual port used and /v1 appended with http scheme.
The writer SHALL create missing agentDir parents and deterministically overwrite agentDir/models.yml with block YAML containing providers.workbuddy: api openai-completions, supplied proxyBaseUrl, literal apiKey WORKBUDDY_MODEL_TOKEN, and exactly one model with supplied id/name, contextWindow128000 and maxTokens8192. It SHALL NOT write authHeader or read/expand parent environment credentials. Supplied string values SHALL remain strings and SHALL NOT inject YAML properties. Identical inputs SHALL produce identical bytes; changed inputs SHALL replace obsolete managed content. Filesystem failures SHALL reject rather than report success. Startup invocation after listen remains a later assembly responsibility, not this module's side effect.

#### Scenario: Connectable address derivation
- WHEN the actual listener address is0.0.0.0:18016 or IPv6:::18016
- THEN URLs are http://127.0.0.1:18016/v1 and http://[::1]:18016/v1 respectively
- WHEN an explicit IPv4 or IPv6 address is supplied
- THEN that address and actual port are retained with correct IPv6 brackets

#### Scenario: Credential-safe managed output
- WHEN generation runs with proxyBaseUrl http://127.0.0.1:18016/v1 and modelId deepseek-v4.1-flash while parent upstream/token environment sentinels exist
- THEN parsed output contains only the declared workbuddy provider/model, literal env-name apiKey, required limits and no authHeader; file content contains none of the unrelated sentinel values

#### Scenario: Deterministic overwrite and escaped model identity
- WHEN identical options are written twice, then a different modelId containing quotes, newline and YAML-significant characters is written
- THEN the first two files are byte-identical and the final parsed file preserves the exact new modelId/name without extra keys/providers or stale model entries

#### Scenario: Real filesystem ownership
- WHEN agentDir does not yet exist
- THEN its parents and models.yml are created and readable after the promise resolves
- WHEN agentDir cannot be created or models.yml cannot be written because a regular file occupies a needed directory path
- THEN the promise rejects and unrelated files remain unchanged
