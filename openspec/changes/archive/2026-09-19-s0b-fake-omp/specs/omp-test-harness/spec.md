## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: 假 omp 进程契约
The standalone zero-dependency Node fixture SHALL expose JSONL stdin/stdout frames matching omp v18.0.10 commit 33cc6b9a043a74e00a157e72ca909272796d8461 for its supported commands, with explicit argv-selected scenarios. It SHALL not replace production code or contact a real model service in its contract tests.

#### Scenario: 默认握手与完整回合
- WHEN a spawned fixture receives negotiate_protocol version 2, get_state and prompt with request ids
- THEN ready advertises supported transport; successful responses echo ids, negotiation data has protocolVersion 2, get_state data has nonempty sessionFile; prompt ack precedes a turn containing at least three message_update.assistantMessageEvent text_delta frames, matching tool_execution_start/end, assistant message_end and terminal agent_end

#### Scenario: 握手故障与进程退出
- WHEN no-ready or missing-session is selected
- THEN respectively no ready frame is emitted or get_state omits sessionFile, while the difference is observable through a real subprocess
- WHEN idle normal stdin closes
- THEN the process exits cleanly without leaking resources

#### Scenario: 字节级分块与交错
- WHEN chunked get_state follows successful v2 negotiation
- THEN rpc_chunk frames are individually within 1MiB and concatenate decoded bytes into the exact greater-than-3MiB Unicode JSON object; chunkId/index/count/byteLength are consistent
- WHEN interleaved is selected
- THEN an unrelated frame deliberately interrupts that sequence so downstream decoders can reject it

#### Scenario: 回合失败与交互取消
- WHEN crash or error is selected and a prompt is accepted
- THEN crash exits nonzero without terminal completion, while error emits assistant stopReason error with errorMessage before terminal agent_end
- WHEN extension-ui is selected
- THEN a confirm request is emitted, and terminal completion waits for a matching cancelled extension_ui_response

#### Scenario: 真实代理承载
- WHEN call-proxy reads the managed providers.workbuddy configuration and receives a prompt
- THEN it POSTs prompt messages with stream true to baseUrl/chat/completions using the environment WORKBUDDY_MODEL_TOKEN bearer, maps local upstream SSE content chunks to text_delta without byte-boundary corruption, and ends the turn after DONE
- WHEN configuration is invalid or the local HTTP request fails
- THEN the failure is observable without a fabricated successful reply or a token leak into stdout/stderr
