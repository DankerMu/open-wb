# Spec delta: omp-runtime（#462 runtime `onExit` / pending 集合 / 审批转接）

> - 「每会话生命周期」：父 delta 同名块整段逐字（MODIFIED）。父块相对主 spec 的增量（pending 集合句、`onExit` 恒接线句、Scenario「Pending approval suspends idle expiry」「Several pending approvals suspend idle until the last is cleared」「Every exit reaches onExit once」）全部由本 issue 交付，其余句子与 Scenario 与主 spec 一致；归档后父块应与推进后的主 spec 逐字一致。supervisor 侧消费 `onExit`（名额释放、删 slot）归 4.1 #463，登记/结算时调用 `markPending`/`clearPending` 归 4.3 #464，均不在本 delta。
> - 「审批请求经 SessionRuntime 转接」：父 delta 无对应文字，本 issue 自写（编排者追加的 scope，见 proposal「偏离与决定」）；归档时父 omp-runtime delta 须补同一块。
> - 「omp 运行时源码模块划分」：以主 spec 为底，自写追加一句导入边界与一个 Scenario；父 delta 无此块，原样推进。

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: 每会话生命周期
SessionRuntime SHALL lazily acquire one child generation on the first prompt, reuse it across completed turns, reset its injected-clock idle timer on every child frame and accepted prompt, and retire it on idle expiry or shutdown. The runtime SHALL track pending approvals of the current generation as a set keyed by approval id: `markPending(approvalId)` adds the id, `clearPending(approvalId)` removes it, marking an id already present or clearing an id not present SHALL be a no-op, and several ids MAY be pending at once. While the set is non-empty the idle timer SHALL be suspended; when the last pending id is cleared the timer SHALL be re-armed with the full idle duration from that moment. The set SHALL be discarded with its generation. Retirement SHALL close stdin, send SIGTERM if still alive after 5 seconds, and SIGKILL if still alive after a further 3 seconds. Tokens SHALL be issued per generation and revoked exactly once on native death or failed startup without a live child. Caller-provided persisted resumePath and later successful sessionFile SHALL be retained as the last-known-good path for --resume; failed startup SHALL preserve that path, and only startup with no known path SHALL retry cold. Interrupted active turns SHALL fail and report the original child exit once. Every native exit of a generation that obtained a live child — idle expiry, explicit shutdown/retirement (including supervisor-driven eviction), crash during or between turns — SHALL invoke the caller-provided `onExit` callback exactly once with the original code/signal, whether or not a turn was active; the callback SHALL run after the generation's token is revoked and SHALL NOT be invoked for a generation that never obtained a pid. Public shutdown SHALL be idempotent and prevent subsequent prompts.

#### Scenario: Lazy startup and normal reuse
- **WHEN** a runtime is constructed, then receives and completes two prompts
- **THEN** construction issues no token and spawns no process; both prompts run through one child and expose all ordered frames through the true terminal event

#### Scenario: Idle reset and restart
- **WHEN** child frames or a new prompt arrive before idle expires, then activity stops for the configured duration
- **THEN** each activity resets the deadline; expiry closes stdin and reclaims the child, revokes its token, and the next prompt spawns with a fresh token and the exact last successful sessionFile as --resume

#### Scenario: Pending approval suspends idle expiry
- **WHEN** an approval request is marked pending and the injected clock advances past the idle duration, then the approval is cleared
- **THEN** no retirement occurs while pending; after clearing, the child is retired only once the full idle duration elapses again without activity

#### Scenario: Several pending approvals suspend idle until the last is cleared
- **WHEN** approvals `a1` and `a2` are marked pending, `clearPending(a1)` is called twice, the injected clock advances past the idle duration, and then `clearPending(a2)` is called
- **THEN** no retirement occurs while `a2` is still pending (the repeated clear of `a1` does not re-arm the timer); after clearing `a2` the child is retired only once the full idle duration elapses again without activity

#### Scenario: Every exit reaches onExit once
- **WHEN** a generation exits through idle expiry, through shutdown, through an externally requested retirement between turns, or through a crash
- **THEN** `onExit` is invoked exactly once per generation with the actual code/signal in each case, after its token is revoked; a generation that never obtained a pid produces no `onExit` call

#### Scenario: Persisted resume in a new runtime
- **WHEN** a newly constructed runtime receives a previously persisted sessionFile from its caller, including after an unsuccessful first startup
- **THEN** its first and retry spawns use the exact --resume path until a new successful handshake replaces it; omitted/null initial path produces no --resume argument

#### Scenario: Bounded escalation
- **WHEN** a retiring child exits on EOF, waits for TERM, or ignores EOF and TERM
- **THEN** real process observation respectively proves no unnecessary signal, TERM at 5000ms, or KILL at 8000ms; no signal occurs before its deadline, early death cancels remaining escalation, and shutdown observes actual native exit without fabricating it

#### Scenario: Crash during a turn
- **WHEN** a child exits before a terminal prompt outcome
- **THEN** already received frames remain observable, the active iterator fails, the exit callback receives the original code/signal exactly once, the token is revoked and the next prompt resumes using the successful sessionFile

#### Scenario: Startup failure and shutdown race
- **WHEN** startup fails before a sessionFile is accepted or shutdown races delayed startup
- **THEN** no false successful session path is retained, every acquired child/token is reclaimed, no prompt is sent after shutdown, and cold retry is possible only on a runtime not explicitly shut down

#### Scenario: Prompt lifecycle signals
- **WHEN** an ACK, nonterminal agent_end, unrelated response, matching local-only outcome or matching delayed failure arrives
- **THEN** ACK/nonterminal/unrelated frames do not end the turn; agent_end with isTerminal absent or true completes it, matching agentInvoked=false completes local-only work, and a same-id failure after ACK fails the turn; events before ACK remain visible

#### Scenario: Concurrency and abandoned consumption
- **WHEN** prompts overlap or a consumer abandons an active iterator
- **THEN** overlap is rejected without a second command/child and abandonment reclaims the active generation instead of making it available for an overlapping turn

#### Scenario: Native death before pipe closure
- **WHEN** native exit precedes buffered terminal frames or stdout is held open
- **THEN** token revocation does not wait for pipe closure, valid buffered frames are drained before logical completion, and held pipes are reclaimed within the 8-second drain budget with unfinished work failed using the original exit

#### Scenario: Retired generation callbacks and transport errors
- **WHEN** old frame/exit/timer callbacks arrive after retirement, or transport failure interrupts an active turn
- **THEN** old callbacks cannot affect the new child, token or turn; transport failure is sanitized, fails the current turn and reclaims its generation rather than silently yielding success

### Requirement: omp 运行时源码模块划分
`server/src/sessions/omp/` 下的运行时实现 SHALL 保持每个源文件 ≤800 行（`scripts/size-guard.sh`）。`omp/commands.ts` SHALL 承载 `SessionRuntime` 的模块级辅助（waiter 与 generation/turn 结构、子进程存活与 stdio 辅助、延时竞速、deferred 与帧判定辅助）以及 command/abort/pending 计时面，由 `omp/runtime.ts` 引用；它 SHALL 不新增未被引用的导出，且对 `runtime.ts` 只有类型导入。`SessionRuntime`、`OmpProcess`/`spawnOmp` 的公开签名与导入路径 SHALL 保持在 `runtime.ts`/`process.ts`。`omp/ui-requests.ts` SHALL 承载 `extension_ui_request` 的分类（审批请求或即时回绝）、审批 `title` 的工具名解析与 `extension_ui_response` 应答帧形状：它是无状态的纯函数模块，不持有传输状态、不写子进程 stdin，不导入 `./process.js`、`./runtime.js` 或 `./commands.js`；`OmpProcess` 仍是 `extension_ui_response` 的唯一写出者，由它决定是否与何时写出。`runtime.ts` 与 `commands.ts` 对 `./ui-requests.js` SHALL 至多有语句级 `import type`（不得有值导入、副作用导入、动态导入，也不得 re-export 其中的符号），审批请求的类型可由此引入，应答帧的构造与写出不得出现在这两个文件中。

#### Scenario: 模块划分可持续验证
- **WHEN** 运行 `bash scripts/size-guard.sh`、`knip` 与 server 测试
- **THEN** size-guard 退出 0，knip 无未引用导出，`runtime.ts` 从 `./commands.js` 引用上述辅助而 `commands.ts` 对 `./runtime.js` 只有 `import type`，runtime/process 测试全绿

#### Scenario: UI 请求分类模块边界
- **WHEN** 运行 `knip`、`bash scripts/size-guard.sh`，并检查 `server/src/sessions/omp/` 的导入方向与 `extension_ui_response` 写出点
- **THEN** `process.ts` 从 `./ui-requests.js` 引用分类、工具名解析与应答帧形状；`ui-requests.ts` 不导入 `./process.js`、`./runtime.js`、`./commands.js`；`server/src/sessions/omp/` 中只有 `process.ts` 向子进程 stdin 写出 `extension_ui_response`；size-guard 退出 0，knip 无未引用导出

#### Scenario: 运行时对 UI 请求模块只有类型依赖
- **WHEN** 检查 `server/src/sessions/omp/runtime.ts` 与 `commands.ts` 中引用 `./ui-requests.js` 的全部语句
- **THEN** 每一条都是语句级 `import type`，不存在值导入、副作用导入、动态导入或 re-export；两个文件都不含 `extension_ui_response` 字面量，也不引用应答帧构造函数

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: 审批请求经 SessionRuntime 转接
SessionRuntime SHALL accept an optional synchronous constructor callback `onApproval(request)` and SHALL forward to it, synchronously and unchanged, each approval request (`{id, title, tool}`, see 「RPC IO and child observation」) surfaced by the `OmpProcess` of a generation, but only when that generation is still the runtime's current generation and a prompt turn whose `prompt` frame has been written is active on that generation — the same generation/turn gate that decides whether a child frame joins the active turn. An approval request surfaced by a generation that is no longer current, or arriving while no such turn is active on the current generation (between turns, or before the turn's `prompt` frame is written), SHALL be dropped: it is not forwarded and not answered, and it simply ends with that child like any unanswered approval. Forwarding SHALL NOT mark the approval pending and SHALL NOT affect the idle timer by itself; `markPending`/`clearPending` remain explicit owner calls. SessionRuntime SHALL expose `respondApproval(id, decision)` that passes the owner's `allow`/`deny` answer unchanged to the current generation's `OmpProcess.respondApproval`, and SHALL be a no-op — no frame, no throw, no spawn — when the runtime has no current generation (before the first acquisition, after retirement, after shutdown) or when the current generation's `OmpProcess` no longer accepts input (for example while it is retiring). SessionRuntime SHALL NOT answer an approval request on its own and SHALL NOT write `extension_ui_response` itself; `OmpProcess` remains its only writer.

#### Scenario: Approval requests reach the owner only from the active turn of the current generation
- **WHEN** the real fake `approval` scenario, spawned with `--approval-mode write`, surfaces select `r1` during an active prompt turn of the current generation, and separately an approval-shaped select is surfaced between turns, before the turn's `prompt` frame is written, or by a generation that is no longer current
- **THEN** `onApproval` is called exactly once with `{id:"r1", title, tool:"bash"}` carrying the original title; the other requests are never forwarded and no `extension_ui_response` is written for them

#### Scenario: respondApproval passes through to the current generation
- **WHEN** the owner calls `respondApproval("r1","allow")` on the runtime for the forwarded request, then calls it again, and separately calls it before any generation exists, while the generation is retiring and after shutdown
- **THEN** exactly one `extension_ui_response{id:"r1",value:"Approve"}` reaches the child, which proceeds to finish the tool call and the turn; every other call writes nothing, throws nothing and spawns no child

#### Scenario: Forwarding alone does not suspend idle expiry
- **WHEN** an approval request is forwarded and the owner does not call `markPending`, and the injected clock then advances by the idle duration
- **THEN** the generation is retired on idle expiry as usual, no answer is written for the outstanding approval, and `onExit` reports the child's actual exit once
