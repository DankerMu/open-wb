## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Pid-less spawn failure retirement
A SessionRuntime generation whose child never obtained a pid SHALL be treated as having no live child from the moment spawn returns. Retiring such a generation, whether by shutdown, idle expiry or cancellation, and even when retirement starts before Node reports the spawn error, SHALL revoke its token exactly once and complete without waiting for any TERM/KILL grace and without awaiting a native exit, independent of whether the failed child ever reports `exitCode` or emits `'error'`. A child that obtained a pid SHALL keep the existing retirement contract even if it later emits `'error'` while still running.

#### Scenario: Shutdown races a missing-binary spawn
- **WHEN** shutdown starts inside the spawn call of a missing-binary generation, before the spawn error tick
- **THEN** shutdown settles without advancing the injected clock, no timers remain pending, no signal is sent, the token is revoked exactly once and the prompt rejects with agent_unavailable

#### Scenario: Pid-less child that never reports failure
- **WHEN** spawn returns a pid-less child that never emits `'error'` and never sets `exitCode`
- **THEN** shutdown still settles at clock 0 with no pending timers

#### Scenario: Live child emitting error keeps the grace contract
- **WHEN** a child with a pid emits `'error'` while still running and the generation is retired
- **THEN** stdin is closed, SIGTERM is sent at 5000 ms and SIGKILL at 8000 ms unless the child actually exits first
