## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: 假 omp probe 回报
For prompt `probe:<pid>:<writePath>`, the fake omp SHALL first attempt to write UTF-8 `probe` at the complete writePath using its own credentials, then attempt to read `/proc/<pid>/environ`. It SHALL emit one text delta with fields in order `uid=<uid> gid=<gid> env=<comma-separated sorted environment keys> home=<HOME> agent=<PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR> environ=<readable|errno> wrote=<ok|errno>`, based on its own process and actual IO outcomes. It SHALL reuse normal prompt acknowledgement and assistant stop/terminal agent_end frames even when either IO operation fails. It SHALL not disclose arbitrary environment values or proc contents. Non-probe behavior SHALL remain unchanged.

#### Scenario: 同 uid 成功
- WHEN an ordinary Linux real child receives a probe for its same-uid parent with a writable test-owned path containing colons and spaces
- THEN identity equals that of the parent, environment keys are sorted, HOME/agent equal supplied values, environ is readable, wrote is ok, and exact file content is probe before normal completion

#### Scenario: IO 失败独立回报
- WHEN the destination parent does not exist or the target proc pid does not exist
- THEN the failed operation reports ENOENT, the other operation is still attempted and truthfully reported, and the process emits its normal terminal completion

#### Scenario: 非 Linux 不伪造证明
- WHEN the child runs on macOS without procfs
- THEN it reports the actual proc read errno while identity, environment, file content and terminal behavior remain verifiable; this result is not reported as Linux readability or uid isolation proof

#### Scenario: 非 probe 兼容
- WHEN an existing non-probe prompt/scenario is exercised
- THEN the #87 handshake, scenario-specific frame sequence, and normal shutdown remain unchanged
