# Changelog

All notable changes to this skill will be documented in this file.
This project adheres to [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.8.0] - 2026-07-29

### Added

- **合并 `entropy-review` 为本 skill 的 consistency 模式**：八个熵维度、E0–E3 分级、约束上下文加载与 Constraint Gaps 报告移入 `references/consistency-checklist.md`（含 P 级 crosswalk）。consistency-only 请求（"is this consistent with our conventions?"、naming drift）走 consistency 模式；常规 review 在变更引入新标识符/模式时把 consistency 作为一条分析轴。合并动机：entropy-review 与 review 靠 negative constraint 互相划界，构成常驻 listing 路由税；"consistency only, not correctness" 本质是 review 的一个维度而非独立 skill。

### Changed

- **Thin-core 拆分**：SKILL.md 从 19.2KB 精简到 ~10.7KB。输出模板/finding 协议/tone 下沉 `references/output-formats.md`；行为变更分析、removal inventory、open questions、impact analysis、spec 轴细则下沉 `references/analysis-guides.md`。正文保留决策骨架：激活边界、模式表、内容类型路由表、分析原则、severity 表与 verdict 逻辑。

## [0.7.0] - 2026-07-14

### Added
- Testing checklist（`references/code-checklist.md`）补齐 build 侧纪律的审查残影，adapted from `mattpocock/skills` v1.1.0 `tdd`（`mocking.md`/`tests.md`）：**mock 纪律倒置**（只在系统边界 mock，mock 自家模块/内部协作者=耦合结构而非行为；对内部断言调用次数/顺序同罪）；**边界可 mock 性被设计掉**（外部客户端函数内构造而非注入；泛型 fetcher 取代 SDK 式按操作具名函数——迫使 mock 内含条件逻辑、看不出测试行使的端点、丢失按端点类型安全）；**批量先行的"形状"测试**（横切反模式的审查残影：断言结构/想象行为而非用户可见行为，对真实变化麻木）；单测试多逻辑断言、测试名说 HOW 不说 WHAT、有领域术语表（`openspec/glossary.md`）时命名不用其词汇。

## [0.6.3] - 2026-07-11

- Tighten the hybrid trigger description from 679 to 485 characters (slimming batch 6), eval-gated by the new cross-skill routing suite (`skill-lifecycle-manager/eval/cross-skill-routing-cases.json`): three A/B runs, zero per-case routing regressions, candidate 27/27 on the final run (deepseek-v4-pro-guan judge via dmxapi). All negative redirects preserved.

## [0.6.2] - 2026-07-11

- Compress When Not To Activate into arrow form (slimming batch 4); all boundaries and redirect targets preserved, including the redirect targets that previously sat in the trailing paragraph.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-07-11

- Remove the body invocation-posture restatement; posture lives in frontmatter/description.
- Remove the maintainer-facing `## Validation And Evaluation` note from the runtime body; eval suites remain canonical under `eval/`.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-07-11

### Added
- Spec-conformance as a second review axis, adapted from `mattpocock/skills` v1.1.0 `code-review`: Phase 1e locates the originating spec (linked issue/PRD → user-passed path → `docs/`/`specs/`/`openspec/` match; skip the axis honestly when none exists), Phase 2 checks missing/partial, unrequested (scope creep), and implemented-but-wrong against the quoted spec line, and Phase 3 enforces "two axes, no masking" — spec findings report under their own group with a worst-finding-per-axis summary, never merged or reranked against standards findings.
- Testing checklist (`references/code-checklist.md`): tautological-test anti-pattern (assertion recomputes the expected value the way the code does — expected values must come from an independent source of truth) and seam discipline (tests belong at public boundaries, not internals or side channels), adapted from the upstream `tdd` skill.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-07-02

### Added
- Cross-skill routing in "When Not To Activate": multi-perspective, high-risk, or risk-adaptive-depth reviews route to `risk-adaptive-cross-review`; consistency, drift, or pattern-duplication-only concerns route to `entropy-review`.
- Severity-crosswalk pointer near the severity table: P3/Nit maps to "Note" in the `risk-adaptive-cross-review` finding contract when findings are folded into a cross-review.
- Canonical-source note: for `subagent-workflow` Phase 4, `reviewer-packages.md` in `risk-adaptive-cross-review` is the canonical checklist source; this skill's per-type checklists serve standalone single-pass reviews.
- Expanded eval coverage to check two new protocol contracts:
  - clear findings should not be softened into open questions
  - review should happen before repair, even when a follow-up fix may be appropriate

### Changed
- Clarified that validation and eval guidance in `SKILL.md` is for maintainers of the canonical package, not a runtime requirement for projected installs on other repositories.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-03-28

### Changed
- **Positioned the skill for agent review of artifacts**: reframed the core description and opening summary around agent-performed, artifact-scoped review rather than reviewer coaching or general feedback conversations. Also expanded the `skill.json` metadata description to match the broader review surface (migrations, infrastructure/config) documented in `SKILL.md`.
- **Tightened trigger boundaries**: removed `audit` and broad quality-language from the primary trigger path, added an explicit `## When Not To Activate` section, and made explicit invocation guidance platform-neutral.
- **Strengthened finding protocol**: P0/P1/P2 findings now require issue, consequence, evidence, and fix direction; clear bugs should no longer be softened into open-ended questions.
- **Reduced low-value review noise**: added explicit non-findings guidance for formatter noise, import ordering, lint-only issues, and style-only feedback without real consequence.
- **Made Phase 4 explicitly review-first**: findings must be presented before edits; fixes happen only after the user asks for them or chooses a next-step option.
- **Reworked tone for agent review**: shifted from conversation-oriented reviewer guidance toward direct, evidence-based, severity-calibrated output with brief, selective praise.

### Added
- **Validation and evaluation guidance** in `SKILL.md`, including concrete `quick_validate.py`, `validate_projection.py`, and `validate_eval_suite.py` commands.
- **Structured eval assets** under `eval/`:
  - `eval/trigger-posture-cases.json` for trigger-boundary and mode-selection checks
  - `eval/eval-cases.json` for realistic end-to-end review quality checks
- **`projection.json`** so author-only roots like `eval/` stay out of runtime projections.

## [0.4.2] - 2026-03-27

### Changed
- **Invocation posture declared as `hybrid`**: added `invocation_posture: hybrid` to SKILL.md frontmatter; documented posture and negative cases in "When to Activate".
- **Description tightened**: removed vague auto-trigger phrases ("what do you think?", "look over this", "anything wrong here?", standalone "audit") that caused false positives on design discussions. High-confidence explicit triggers retained.
- **Verdict logic clarified**: removed ambiguous "minor P1s" wording. Now: ✅ = no P0/P1; ⚠️ = no P0, exactly 1 acknowledged P1 with a clear fix; 🔴 = any P0, 2+ P1s, or any unaddressed P1.
- **`gh` added to tool requirements**: Phase 1a uses `gh pr diff`; it was missing from `skill.json`.
- **`filesystemWrite` corrected to `true`**: Phase 4 applies code and doc fixes directly; `false` was misleading.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-03-25

### Fixed
- **Severity table**: merged duplicate P2 rows into one to avoid ambiguity.
- **Dimensions column**: clarified that listed dimensions are highlights — the reference file contains the full checklist to apply.
- **Quick mode missing Open Questions**: added optional `❓` question line to Quick mode template.

### Changed
- **Review mode selection**: added risk-based override — high-risk content types (auth, payment, DB schema, public API) upgrade to Standard even with ≤3 files.
- **Phase 4 Act**: differentiated action menus by content type — code gets direct fixes, docs get rewrites, design docs/PRDs get suggestions (author decides).
- **Phase 1b project conventions**: made agent-agnostic — instructs to check what's already in context before reading files, lists convention files from multiple agents (`CLAUDE.md`, `.cursorrules`, `AGENTS.md`, `copilot-instructions.md`).

## [0.4.0] - 2026-03-25

### Added
- **Behavioral change analysis**: Dedicated section guiding the reviewer to check for state model changes, error handling shifts, default value changes, timing/ordering changes, API contract breaks, and scope narrowing. Addresses the finding that skill-guided reviews can over-focus on code patterns and miss behavioral differences in refactoring PRs.
- **Removal inventory** (Deep mode): Checklist for large refactoring PRs to verify clean removal of deleted types/functions — no orphaned imports, stale configs, or dead test helpers.
- **"Look beyond code patterns" principle** in Phase 2: Explicit reminder to check whether new code behaves identically to old code, not just whether it follows coding standards.
- Deep mode output template now includes "Behavioral Changes" and "Removal Inventory" sections.

### Context
- Driven by four-way comparison on openai/codex PR #15424 (8874-line refactoring diff). Baseline (no skill) outperformed all skill-guided reviews on behavioral/architectural findings. This version addresses that gap.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-25

### Added
- **Open Questions section**: Reviews now surface things the reviewer can't determine from the diff alone — design intent, implementation details outside the diff, missing context about contracts or consumers. Inspired by code-review-excellence skill's "Questions" pattern.
- **Severity calibration guidance**: Explicit instruction to avoid under-rating maintainability issues as P3 when they have real consequences (e.g., duplicated logic that will silently diverge).

### Changed
- P2 severity description expanded: now explicitly includes DRY violations (>2 copies) and inconsistent conventions that confuse consumers.
- P3 description tightened: only for style preferences with no real consequence.
- Standard mode output template now includes a "Questions" section between "What Looks Good" and "Quick Wins".

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-25

### Changed
- **Restructured SKILL.md**: moved detailed checklists to `references/` directory. SKILL.md now focuses on process, judgment framework, and output templates (~180 lines vs ~350 before).
- **Differentiated output by mode**: Quick mode uses inline format (no template overhead), Standard uses structured template, Deep adds impact analysis and summary table.
- **Content type priority system**: numbered priority resolves overlaps (e.g., `*.tsx` in `__tests__/` → Tests, not Frontend).

### Added
- **Project context awareness** (Phase 1b): reads `CLAUDE.md`, linter configs, PR templates before reviewing to respect team conventions.
- **Cross-cutting concerns**: code-doc consistency check, missing companion detection (new endpoint with no tests, etc.).
- `references/code-checklist.md`: detailed checks for Code, Frontend, Database, Infrastructure, and Tests.
- `references/content-checklist.md`: detailed checks for Documentation, API Specs, Design Docs/PRDs, and Configuration.
